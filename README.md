# C1C Recruitment Bot

C1C Recruitment keeps guild recruiting conversations on track. It gives quick status
checks when you need them and quietly monitors the background so staff stay in sync
without extra chatter.

## How to talk to the bot
- Use `!rec <command>` in channel, for example `!rec ping` or `!rec help`.
- Mention the bot directly: `@C1C Recruitment help`.

## What to expect
- Fast responses to `ping` so you know the connection is healthy.
- Friendly `help` guidance so everyone sees the available commands.
- Low chat noise. The bot handles heartbeat and health checks behind the scenes.

## Privacy & safety
- The bot never asks for DMs and does not collect secrets in chat.
- Staff-only operations stay gated to the appropriate server roles.

## Need support?
If a command is quiet, double-check that you prefixed it with `!rec`. Still stuck?
Reach out to a server adminâ€”they can confirm the bot is online and your role has access.
