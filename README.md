C1C Recruitment Bot v0.9.5  
Welcome to the C1C recruitment helper.  
The bot keeps clan rosters healthy, helps new friends find their hall, and makes sure every welcome lands in the right place.

### What you can do today
!rec help — lists all commands available to you.  
!clan <tag> — shows a quick profile for any clan in the cluster.  
!clanmatch — opens the recruiter panel where staff help players find a home.  
!welcome — posts the standard welcome note once a recruit joins.  

The bot pulls live data from the cluster sheets so info stays current.

### Need help?
Ask the recruitment team in Discord for a quick walkthrough.  
If something looks off, drop a note in #bot-production so staff can check the logs.
