# C1C Recruitment Bot v0.9.6
Welcome to the C1C recruitment helper.  
The bot keeps clan rosters healthy, helps new friends find their hall, and makes sure every welcome lands in the right place.

### What you can do today
@Bot help — lists the commands your role can use and tips for each.
@Bot ping — quick pong reaction so you can confirm the bot is awake.
!clan <tag> — shows a quick profile for any clan in the cluster.
!clansearch — opens the member search panel with the latest roster filters.
!clanmatch — recruiter-only panel to match players with open clans.
!welcome — staff command that posts the legacy welcome embed (crest, ping, notice) with optional note support.

The bot pulls live data from the cluster sheets so info stays current.
