# [EPIC] ‚Äî Welcome & Placement v2  
**Phase:** 7 ‚Äî Placement Tools  
**Milestone:** Harmonize v1.0  
**Status:** Specification (pre-implementation)  
**Related ADR:** 0017 ‚Äî Reservations & Placement Schema  
**Modules affected:** onboarding, placement, recruitment, sheets services  
**Owner:** Recruitment Bot (CoreOps-aligned)

---

## 1 ¬∑ Purpose  
Integrate the legacy WelcomeCrew flow with new placement tools.  
Every welcome or promo ticket thread becomes a self-contained onboarding process:  
questionnaire ‚Üí recruiter review ‚Üí clan placement or reservation.  
All operations are Config-driven, RBAC-checked, and log-visible.

---

## 2 ¬∑ User Roles  
| Role | Abilities |
| --- | --- |
| Recruit | answers questionnaire only |
| Recruiter | may reserve, change, cancel, renew spots |
| Guardian Knight | closes threads; finalizes placements |
| Bot | handles joins, dialogs, timers, Sheet sync |

---

## 3 ¬∑ Channels  
| Channel | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID` | external recruits |
| `PROMO_CHANNEL_ID` | members |

Threads: `####-username` (Ticket Tool default).  
Bot joins automatically if parent matches either channel.

---

## 4 ¬∑ Feature Toggles & Config  
All toggles live in **FeatureToggles** tab, not ENV.

| Key | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `placement_reservations` | false | enables reservation UI + timers |
| `welcome_dialog` | false | enables questionnaire dialogs |
| `placement_target_select` | true | legacy close-panel placement |
| (from Config tab) `CLANS_TAB` | `bot_info` | clan data tab name |

Missing Config ‚Üí log channel warning + safe disable.

---

## 5 ¬∑ Lifecycle

1. **Thread creation**
   Ticket Tool opens thread ‚Üí bot joins.
   If `welcome_dialog` enabled, the bot waits for the Ticket Tool **Close-button message**, reacts üëç, and starts the welcome dialog.

### Manual Fallback Trigger (Testing & Admin Use)
When welcome_dialog is enabled, the Welcome Dialog can now start through two verified triggers:

Automated Trigger (Ticket Tool) ‚Äì When a welcome or promo thread is closed by Ticket Tool, the bot automatically starts the dialog (source="ticket").

Manual Trigger (üß≠ Reaction) ‚Äì Recruiters, Staff, or Admins can manually start the same dialog by reacting with üß≠ on the first message of a valid welcome or promo thread (source="emoji").

Both paths call the shared entrypoint start_welcome_dialog(...), which manages scope checks, deduplication through a pinned marker, and structured logging.

The interactive dialog modal and summary embed are scheduled for the next phase.

2. **Questionnaire**
   Multi-page modal (per channel).
   On completion, bot posts **summary embed** with recruiter-only controls:
   *Reserve Spot*, *Change*, *Cancel*.

3. **Reservation flow** (`placement_reservations`)  
   - Clan dropdown populated from **Onboarding ‚Üí ClanList (column B)**.  
   - Date/time input uses the same picker logic as the Ticket Tool **Close** flow.  
   - On submit: add or update reservation row, then recompute AF & AI immediately.

4. **Thread close**  
   Legacy close watcher behavior remains untouched.  
   If a reservation exists:  
   - **Same clan** ‚Üí delete reservation, no count change.  
   - **Different clan** ‚Üí delete reservation, free one slot.  
   Onboarding log unchanged.

5. **Reservation expiry**  
   Background loop checks timers every 15 min.  
   On expiry ‚Üí mark row expired, recompute, ping `RECRUITER_ROLE_IDS` in thread with **Renew** button (opens same date modal).

6. **Refresh & restart**  
   - On boot ‚Üí rebuild timers from `Reservations`.  
   - Every **3 hours** (existing cron) ‚Üí batch recompute AF & AI for all clans.  
   - `!ops refresh clansinfo` / `!ops refresh all` ‚Üí manual trigger.

## 6 ¬∑ Data Model

### 6.1 CLANS_TAB (`bot_info`)  
Data starts at **row 4** (rows 1‚Äì3 = header).

| Col | Meaning | Maintained by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AF | Open spots (corrected) | Bot | `E = max(0, AG ‚àí active_res)` |
| AG | Inactives | Manual | untouched |
| AI | Reservation display | Bot | `N ‚Üí @user1, @user2` |
| E | Manual open spots | Manual | source value |

**Important:** `clan_tag` values in Reservations are validated against **Onboarding ‚Üí ClanList (column B)**, not CLANS_TAB.

### 6.2 Reservations tab
| Field | Type | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `thread_id` | int | 125839402393 | Discord thread |
| `ticket_user_id` | int | 95830240231 | recruit |
| `recruiter_id` | int | 8392012345 | staff |
| `clan_tag` | str | C1CM | short tag from ClanList (B) |
| `clan_name` | str | Martyrs | optional display copy |
| `reserved_until` | datetime | 2025-11-03 22:00 | uses same picker as Close |
| `created_at` | datetime | 2025-10-25 17:02 | auto |
| `status` | enum | active / expired / cancelled / closed_same_clan / closed_other_clan | |
| `notes` | str | optional | comments |

### 6.3 OnboardingQuestions tab
Onboarding dialogs are driven by a shared **OnboardingQuestions** worksheet.

| Column | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `flow` | ‚úÖ | `welcome` or `promo`; selects the dialog build |
| `order` | ‚úÖ | Render order (`7`, `7a`, `8b`, etc.) |
| `qid` | ‚úÖ | Stable identifier used in answers + rules |
| `label` | ‚úÖ | Prompt shown to the recruit |
| `type` | ‚úÖ | `short`, `paragraph`, `number`, `single-select`, or `multi-select-N` |
| `required` | ‚úÖ | `yes`/`no` toggle; rules may downgrade to optional |
| `maxlen` | ‚ùå | Optional text length cap for short/paragraph inputs |
| `validate` | ‚ùå | Free-form validator key (UI hook in Phase 7b) |
| `help` | ‚ùå | Subtext rendered under the prompt |
| `note` | ‚ùå | Select options, comma-separated (e.g. `Beginner, Early Game`) |
| `rules` | ‚ùå | Flow control instructions (see below) |

**Select options:** tokens are canonicalized to lowercase + hyphen for stable comparisons (e.g. `"Early Game"` ‚Üí `early-game`). The display label preserves the sheet text.

**Rules grammar (Phase 7a):**

- `if <token> skip <targets>`
- `if <token> make <targets> optional`

Where `<token>` is a normalized answer token (e.g. `beginner`, `early game`). Targets accept individual orders, `qid`s, or order prefixes suffixed with `*` to include sub-rows (`7*` ‚Üí `7`, `7a`, `7b`). Later phases may extend this grammar.

## 7 ¬∑ Bot Behaviour

| Event | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `on_thread_create` | join thread if parent ‚àà {WELCOME, PROMO} |
| `on_message` | detect Ticket Tool close-button message ‚Üí react üëç ‚Üí start dialog |
| `on_thread_update` | legacy close watcher (unchanged) |
| Reservation buttons | recruiter-only; manage reservation lifecycle |

**Validation:** all clan selections resolved via **ClanList (B)** before any Sheet write.

---

## 8 ¬∑ Recompute Logic  
1. Build valid clan set from **ClanList (B)**.  
2. Group active reservations by `clan_tag`.  
3. For each clan:  
   - `count = len(active)`  
   - `AF = max(0, AG ‚àí count)`  
   - `AI = "{count} ‚Üí " + ", ".join(usernames)`  
4. Batch-update rows (row ‚â• 4).  

Triggered by reservation events, 3 h cron, or manual refresh commands.

---

## 9 ¬∑ Logging & Recovery  
| Event | Log Destination |
| --- | --- |
| Sheet failure | `LOG_CHANNEL_ID` embed + retry |
| Missing config/toggle | log warning |
| Reservation event | runtime line + thread note |
| Expiry | ping + Renew button |
| Invalid clan_tag | thread error + log error |
| Cron summary | info embed (counts / clans) |

---

## 10 ¬∑ Compatibility
| Legacy | New handling |
| --- | --- |
| Watchers | kept, modernized |
| TagPicker UX | retained |
| Name parsing | removed |
| Backfill | kept for audit |
| Watchdog restarts | removed |
| Help embed | untouched |
| Manual headers | Config-driven reads (row 4 start) |

---

## 11 ¬∑ Acceptance
1. Recruiters can reserve / cancel / renew spots.  
2. AF & AI recompute automatically and via cron/commands.  
3. Reservation data survives restarts.  
4. Logging visible in log channel.  
5. RBAC enforced; help auto-lists new actions.  
6. No crash on missing config.
