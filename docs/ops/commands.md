# CoreOps help system â€” Phase 3 + 3b

The help surfaces pull from the command matrix and cache registry to render consistent
copy across tiers. Use the following behavior notes when validating deploys or triaging
reports from staff and recruiters.

## `!help` â€” short index
- **Audience:** Admin-only shortcut; mirrors `!rec help` for the caller's tier.
- **Behavior:** Returns a compact embed grouped by tier with one-line blurbs only. The
  embed footer shows `Bot vX.Y.Z Â· CoreOps vA.B.C`; timestamps are no longer rendered.
- **Tip:** Trigger this after reloads to confirm the tier catalog hydrated from the live
  cache.

### Example (Admin tier excerpt)
```
Admin
- !config â€” Admin embed of the live registry with guild names and sheet linkage.
- !rec reload â€” Rebuild the config registry; optionally schedule a soft reboot.
```

## `!help <command>` â€” detailed view
- **Audience:** Any tier that can see the command in the short index.
- **Behavior:** Expands the command with the detailed copy from the Command Matrix,
  including a **Usage** line, prefix warning (commands accept `!rec` and admin bang
  aliases), and a contextual tip.
- **Footer:** Version info only; embeds omit timestamps to match the new audit policy.
- **Reminder:** The detailed embed highlights when the caller lacks the required tier.

### Example (Admin)
```
!checksheet
Usage: !checksheet [--debug]
Tier: Admin (CoreOps)
Detail: Validate Sheets tabs, named ranges, and headers using public telemetry.
Tip: Run after registry edits or onboarding template changes.
```

### Example (Recruiter / Staff)
```
!rec refresh clansinfo
Usage: !rec refresh clansinfo
Tier: Staff (Recruiter role or higher required)
Detail: Refresh clan roster data when Sheets updates land.
Tip: Re-run if digest ages drift after clan merges.
```

### Example (User)
```
!rec ping
Usage: !rec ping
Tier: User
Detail: Report bot latency and shard status without hitting the cache.
Tip: Ask staff to escalate if latency exceeds 250â€¯ms for more than 5 minutes.
