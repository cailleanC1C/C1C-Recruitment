# CoreOps Help System

The help surfaces pull from the command matrix and cache registry to render consistent
copy across tiers. Use the following behavior notes when validating deploys or triaging
reports from staff and recruiters.

## `@Bot help` ‚Äî overview layout
- **Audience:** Everyone; the embed set filters to the caller‚Äôs access tier.
- **Behavior:** Sends one message containing four embeds in fixed order:
  1. **Overview** ‚Äî long-form description reused verbatim from the legacy help copy.
  2. **Admin / Operational** ‚Äî Config & Health, Sheets & Cache, Permissions, Utilities, Welcome Templates.
  3. **Staff** ‚Äî Recruitment, Sheet Tools, Milestones.
  4. **User** ‚Äî Recruitment, Milestones, General (includes `@Bot help` and `@Bot ping`).
- **Empty sections:** Hidden by default; set `SHOW_EMPTY_SECTIONS=true` to render a
  ‚ÄúComing soon‚Äù placeholder.
- **Footer:** `Bot vX.Y.Z ¬∑ CoreOps vA.B.C ‚Ä¢ For details: @Bot help` on every embed.
- **Tip:** Trigger this after reloads to confirm the tier catalog hydrated from the live
  cache.

### Example (Admin embed excerpt)
```
Admin / Operational ‚Äî Config & Health
‚Ä¢ !rec env ‚Äî Staff snapshot of environment name, guild IDs, and sheet linkage.
‚Ä¢ !rec health ‚Äî Inspect cache/watchdog telemetry pulled from the public API.
```

## `@Bot help <command>` ‚Äî detailed view
- **Audience:** Any tier that can see the command in the short index.
- **Behavior:** Expands the command with the detailed copy from the Command Matrix,
  including a **Usage** line and contextual tip.
- **Footer:** Version info only; embeds omit timestamps to match the new audit policy.
- **Reminder:** The detailed embed highlights when the caller lacks the required tier.

### Example (Admin)
```
!checksheet
Usage: !checksheet [--debug]
Tier: Admin (CoreOps)
Detail: Validate Sheets tabs, named ranges, and headers using public telemetry.
Tip: Run after registry edits or onboarding template changes.
```

### Example (Recruiter / Staff)
```
!rec refresh clansinfo
Usage: !rec refresh clansinfo
Tier: Staff (Recruiter role or higher required)
Detail: Refresh clan roster data when Sheets updates land.
Tip: Re-run if digest ages drift after clan merges.
```

### Example (User)
```
@Bot ping
Usage: @Bot ping
Tier: User
Detail: Report bot latency and shard status without hitting the cache.
Tip: Ask staff to escalate if latency exceeds 250‚ÄØms for more than 5 minutes.
```

## Recruitment commands alignment

### !clan `<tag>`

Shows a clan‚Äôs profile and entry-criteria card.

- **Behavior:** Posts in-channel. Displays the **Profile** card (with crest), adds üí° reaction to toggle between Profile and Entry Criteria.

- **Feature Toggle:** `clan_profile`

### !clansearch

Launches the member-facing search panel.

- **Access:** Public (no role restrictions)
- **Behavior:** Opens an interactive panel that edits its own message whenever filters change so channels do not fill with duplicates.

- **Feature Toggle:** `member_panel`

### !clanmatch

Opens the text-only recruiter panel for filtering and matching clans.

- **Access:** Staff / Recruiters
- **Behavior:** Interactive panel, text-only for speed and mobile usability.

- **Feature Toggle:** `recruiter_panel`

### !welcome `[clan] @mention`

Posts the cached welcome template for the provided clan tag.

- **Access:** Staff / Admin
- **Behavior:** Pulls templates via `shared.sheets` cache; appends any additional note supplied after the mention.
- **Usage:** `!welcome C1CE @Player`
- **Feature Toggle:** `recruitment_welcome`

### `@Bot ping`

Mention-style health check.

- **Access:** Anyone who can see the bot.
- **Behavior:** Invokes the prefix proxy and reacts with üèì so the caller knows the shard is alive.
- **Usage:** `@Bot ping`
- **Notes:** Admins still have access to the hidden `!ping` reaction command; the mention route keeps user help consistent.
