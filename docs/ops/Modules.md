# Ops Module Index

This index lists the primary operational modules. Each entry summarizes responsibilities and links to the detailed module doc that should be treated as the canonical reference for future changes.

## Onboarding
- [`Module-Onboarding.md`](Module-Onboarding.md) — questionnaire engine: loads questions from Sheets, applies rules/validation, tracks session state, persists progress, and hands normalized answers to downstream UX layers.

## Welcome
- [`Module-Welcome.md`](Module-Welcome.md) — Discord UX: posts the welcome panel, renders onboarding prompts inside ticket threads, formats recruiter summaries, and orchestrates ticket closure → placement hand-offs.
