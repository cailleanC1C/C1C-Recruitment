# Configuration Reference

This page is the single source of truth for runtime configuration. Update it alongside
[`.env.example`](.env.example) so the template stays in parity with production settings.

## Live `!config` embed example
```
Configuration Snapshot — prod
Guilds: Clash Champs (Recruitment), Clash Champs Lounge (Onboarding)
Sheets: Recruitment → 1aBCDefGhijKLMnoPqrStuV · Onboarding → 9zYXwvUTsrQpoNMlkJihGFed
Watchers: welcome✅ promo✅
Toggles: STRICT_PROBE=off · SEARCH_RESULTS_SOFT_CAP=25
Meta: Cache age 42s · Next refresh 02:15 UTC · Actor startup
```

- Guild display names replace raw snowflake IDs across the embed.
- Recruitment and Onboarding Sheet IDs appear in full; click-through URLs remain hidden to avoid clutter.
- The meta overlay surfaces cache age, next refresh, and actor pulled from the public telemetry snapshot.
- Date/time fields are removed entirely. Embed footers continue to show `Bot vX.Y.Z · CoreOps vA.B.C` with no timestamp block.

## Environment keys

> The keys below are authoritative. `.env.example` mirrors this list; CI enforces parity.

**Required at startup:** `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `GSPREAD_CREDENTIALS`, `RECRUITMENT_SHEET_ID`

**Optional for startup:** `ONBOARDING_SHEET_ID`*, `ENV_NAME`, `BOT_NAME`, `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL`, `LOG_CHANNEL_ID`, `LOGGING_CHANNEL_ID`, `RECRUITERS_CHANNEL_ID`, `SERVER_MAP_CHANNEL_ID`, `SERVER_MAP_CATEGORY_BLACKLIST`, `SERVER_MAP_CHANNEL_BLACKLIST`, `WHO_WE_ARE_CHANNEL_ID`, `SERVER_MAP_REFRESH_DAYS`, `WATCHDOG_CHECK_SEC`, `WATCHDOG_STALL_SEC`, `WATCHDOG_DISCONNECT_GRACE_SEC`

All sheet-facing modules now require their dedicated `*_SHEET_ID` variables; 

Missing any **Required** key causes the bot to exit with an error at startup. If `LOG_CHANNEL_ID` is empty, Discord channel logging is disabled and a one-time startup warning is emitted.

\* Leaving `ONBOARDING_SHEET_ID` empty allows the process to boot, but onboarding watchers, cache refreshes, and questionnaire-driven commands either skip their work or emit soft errors.

> Local development runner (`scripts/dev_run.sh`) now sources `.env` with `set -a; source ./.env`, preserving quoted and space-containing values verbatim.
>
> The `/emoji-pad` proxy enforces HTTPS-only source URLs. Any HTTP attempt returns `400 invalid source host`.

### Recruitment summary theme
- The welcome summary embed resolves its title icon and colour via `shared.theme` helpers. No new environment keys are required; existing `ICON_*` or `COLOR_*` overrides apply automatically.

## Automation listeners & cron jobs

Event listeners and watcher availability are controlled by FeatureToggles sheet entries rather than ENV variables.

> Cron cadences are fixed in code today; scheduled jobs refresh the `clans`, `templates`, and `clan_tags` cache buckets, post `[cache]` summaries to the ops channel, and emit the Daily Recruiter Update at `REPORT_DAILY_POST_TIME` (UTC). Update the scheduler directly if the defaults change.

## Sheet config tabs
Both Google Sheets referenced above must expose a `Config` worksheet with **Key** and **Value** columns.

### Recruitment runtime state keys
- `SERVER_MAP_MESSAGE_ID_1`, `SERVER_MAP_MESSAGE_ID_2`, … — message IDs for each segment of the server map post in `SERVER_MAP_CHANNEL_ID`. The scheduler edits these messages in place when the structure changes.
- `SERVER_MAP_LAST_RUN_AT` — ISO-8601 timestamp recorded after every successful refresh. The daily job reads this value to enforce `SERVER_MAP_REFRESH_DAYS`.

Blacklist keys for server map rendering are environment variables (`SERVER_MAP_CATEGORY_BLACKLIST`, `SERVER_MAP_CHANNEL_BLACKLIST`) rather than sheet config entries.

The `SERVER_MAP` FeatureToggle in the FeatureToggles worksheet still gates the automation. These blacklist keys only hide specific entries; they do not disable scheduling or posting.

### Recruitment sheet keys
- 'CLANS_TAB'
- 'WELCOME_TEMPLATES_TAB'
- 'FEATURE_TOGGLES_TAB'
- 'REPORTS_TAB'
- 'RESERVATIONS_TAB'
- 'ROLEMAP_TAB'

`RESERVATIONS_TAB` defaults to `Reservations` and stores the structured reservation
ledger used to derive availability. If the key is missing, the adapter falls back
to the default name so new environments remain inert until the sheet configuration
is populated.

`ROLEMAP_TAB` defaults to `WhoWeAre` and stores the category/role listings that
power the `!whoweare` cluster role map command. The worksheet must expose the
columns `category`, `role_ID`, `role_name`, and `role_description` so the bot
can group roles, resolve Discord IDs, and surface the sheet's snarky blurbs.

### Sheet-based Feature Toggles (`Feature_Toggles` tab)

The `Feature_Toggles` worksheet in the Recruitment sheet stores **sheet-only
feature flags**. These keys are **not** environment variables and must **not** be
added to `.env.example`.

Current keys include (non-exhaustive):

- `FEATURE_ONBOARDING` — gates the onboarding flow.
- `FEATURE_REPORTS` — gates recruiter reports.
- `FEATURE_RESERVATIONS` — gates reservation-aware workflows (e.g., `!reserve`,
  reminder jobs) once implemented.
- `SERVER_MAP` — enables the scheduled refresh and manual `!servermap refresh`
  command; channel routing (`SERVER_MAP_CHANNEL_ID`) and cadence
  (`SERVER_MAP_REFRESH_DAYS`) remain environment-driven.
- `ClusterRoleMap` — enables the `!whoweare` command that renders the "Who We
  Are" roster from the configured `ROLEMAP_TAB` worksheet.

If a toggle key is missing in `Feature_Toggles`, its behaviour should default to a
safe value (usually `FALSE`/disabled) so new environments remain inert until
explicitly configured in the sheet.

### Onboarding
- `ONBOARDING_TAB` (string) — Sheet tab name containing the onboarding questions with headers `flow, order, qid, label, type, required, maxlen, validate, help, options, visibility_rules, nav_rules`. Preloaded at startup and refreshed weekly; missing or invalid values surface `missing config key: ONBOARDING_TAB` during refresh.
- `ONBOARDING_SESSIONS_TAB` (string) — Worksheet storing onboarding sessions keyed by `user_id` + `thread_id`. Columns (order enforced): `user_id`, `thread_id`, `panel_message_id`, `step_index`, `completed`, `completed_at`, `answers_json`, `updated_at`, `first_reminder_at`, `warning_sent_at`, `auto_closed_at`.
- Feature toggles `PROMO_ENABLED` and `promo_dialog` gate promo onboarding dialogs (`promo.r`, `promo.m`, `promo.l`). Both must be enabled for promo dialogs to run once detected.

### Onboarding sheet keys
- 'ONBOARDING_TAB'
- 'WELCOME_TICKETS_TAB'
- 'PROMO_TICKETS_TAB'
- 'CLANLIST_TAB'

**Promo tab columns (PROMO_TICKETS_TAB)**

```
ticket number | username | clantag | date closed | type | thread created | year | month | join_month | clan name | progression
```

Promo tickets use the R/M/L prefixes to map to `type` values:

- `R####` → `returning player`
- `M####` → `player move request`
- `L####` → `clan lead move request`

Leave values blank only if a module is disabled via toggles.

#### Feature Toggles
Lists the current feature toggles loaded from the FeatureToggles sheet.

Example:

```
Feature Toggles:
  recruiter_panel = ON
  member_panel = ON
  placement_target_select = ON
  placement_reservations = ON
  clan_profile = ON
```

### Feature toggle highlights

- `WELCOME_ENABLED`, `ENABLE_WELCOME_HOOK` — control welcome watcher activation.
- `PROMO_ENABLED`, `ENABLE_PROMO_HOOK` — control promo watcher activation (no dialogs yet).
- `welcome_dialog`, `promo_dialog` — dialog/panel toggles; promo dialog is reserved for future onboarding steps.

### Milestones sheet keys
- `SHARD_MERCY_TAB` — worksheet name that stores the Shard & Mercy tracker rows
  inside `MILESTONES_SHEET_ID`. No defaults; the config tab must provide the
  exact tab name.
- `SHARD_MERCY_CHANNEL_ID` — Discord channel ID dedicated to shard tracking.
  Commands run outside this channel reply with a routing reminder; the value is
  read from the same milestones Config tab so shard routing stays sheet-driven.

### Feature toggles worksheet

**Config key**

| KEY | VALUE |
| --- | --- |
| 'FEATURE_TOGGLES_TAB' | `FeatureToggles` |

**FeatureToggles tab (recruitment Sheet)**

- Headers: `feature_name`, `enabled` (case-insensitive).
- **Only 'TRUE' (ON) enables a feature.** Any other value ('FALSE', numbers, text, blank) disables it.
- Seed rows:
  ```
  feature_name,enabled
  member_panel,TRUE
  recruiter_panel,TRUE
  recruitment_welcome,TRUE
  recruitment_reports,TRUE
  welcome_dialog,TRUE
  placement_target_select,TRUE
  placement_reservations,TRUE
    SERVER_MAP,TRUE
    WELCOME_ENABLED,TRUE
    ENABLE_WELCOME_HOOK,TRUE
    PROMO_ENABLED,TRUE
    ENABLE_PROMO_HOOK,TRUE
  ```

**Behavior**

- Missing tab or header ⇒ all features disabled; emits one admin-ping warning in the runtime log channel.
- Missing feature row ⇒ that feature disabled; logs one admin-ping warning the first time the key is evaluated.
- Invalid value ⇒ disabled; logs one admin-ping warning per feature key.
- Startup continues regardless; platform services (cache, scheduler, watchdog, RBAC) are never gated.
- The `recruitment_reports` row powers the Daily Recruiter Update (scheduler + manual command). The `placement_*` rows still control stub modules that only log load state.

Feature enable/disable is always sourced from the FeatureToggles worksheet; ENV variables must not be used for feature flags.

**Operator flow**

1. Edit the `FeatureToggles` worksheet in the environment’s Mirralith Sheet.
2. Run `!ops reload` (or the admin bang alias) to pull the latest worksheet values and rebuild the registry.
3. Confirm the tab and headers with `!checksheet`; resolve any ⚠️ rows before retrying.

**Troubleshooting**

- Warnings mention the first role listed in `ADMIN_ROLE_IDS` and are posted to the runtime log channel.
- Verify the worksheet name matches the Config key and that headers are spelled correctly.
- Use `!ops reload` (or the Ops equivalent) to force the bot to re-read the toggles after a fix.

> **Template note:** The `.env.example` file in this directory mirrors the tables below. Treat that file as the canonical template for new deployments and update both assets together.
