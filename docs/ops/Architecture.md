# CoreOps Architecture

The CoreOps runtime now lives in the consolidated [Architecture overview](../Architecture.md).
Use that document for diagrams, flow notes, toggle maps, and help-surface metadata. Operators
should pair it with [`Runbook.md`](Runbook.md) and [`Config.md`](Config.md) for environment-
specific procedures and recovery steps.
