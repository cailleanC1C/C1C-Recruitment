# ADR-0011 â€” Normalize to Modules-First; co-locate Recruitment; prepare `!clansearch`

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Recruitment commands still lived under the legacy top-level `recruitment/`
package and depended on helpers scattered between `shared/`, `ops/`, and a
one-off `sheets/` namespace. The upcoming member panel (`!clansearch`) needs a
clear home and a feature toggle entry point, but the existing layout made it hard
to understand module boundaries or reason about imports.

## Decision

Adopt a Modules-First layout:

* Move recruitment code into `modules/recruitment/` with explicit `services/`
  and `views/` packages.
* Co-locate shared sheet integrations under `shared/sheets/` and expose common
  helpers via `modules/common` (runtime, feature flags, config access).
* Keep CoreOps under `modules/coreops/`, pulling helpers and the Ops cog into the
  same namespace.
* Add a placeholder `cogs/recruitment_member.py` reserved for `!clansearch`,
  gated behind the `member_panel` toggle in the Features sheet.

## Consequences

* Import paths now follow module ownership, reducing circular risks and making
  tests easier to author.
* Moving recruitment under `modules/` clarifies where follow-up work for the
  member panel should live and aligns runtime bootstrapping with feature toggles.
* The `member_panel` flag exists but does not enable new behavior yet; future PRs
  will register the cog when the sheet value is `TRUE`.
