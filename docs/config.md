## Google Sheet Config tab

Each Sheet referenced above must include a `Config` worksheet with two columns: **Key** and **Value**. The bot reads the following rows during startup:

### Recruitment sheet
- `CLANS_TAB`
- `WELCOME_TEMPLATES_TAB`

### Onboarding sheet
- `WELCOME_TICKETS_TAB`
- `PROMO_TICKETS_TAB`
- `CLANLIST_TAB`

Additional keys are ignored until Phase 3 expansion. Leave values blank only if the module is disabled via toggles.
