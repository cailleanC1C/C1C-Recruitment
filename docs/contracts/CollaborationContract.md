## üß≠ C1C Bot Collaboration Ground Rules 

These rules define **how planning and implementation are handled** during bot development.
They apply to **all phases, PRs, and documentation changes**.

---

### üîπ General Workflow

1. **Planning First, Code Later**

   * No code, no PR prompts until I say **‚Äúgive me code please.‚Äù**
   * Until then, only analyze, plan, or audit.

2. **Information Gaps ‚Üí Ask, Don‚Äôt Assume**

   * If something is missing:
     ‚Üí ask for the file, or
     ‚Üí propose a **Codex prompt** to read it.
   * Never invent behavior or structure.

3. **Codex = the Coder**

   * All implementation (new files, fixes, refactors) happens via **Codex PRs**.
   * ChatGPT only prepares the PR prompt.
   * No inline pseudo-code or speculative snippets.

4. **Controlled Progression**

   * Move **one Codex prompt at a time.**
   * Analyze results before the next.
   * Never batch prompts.
   * update relevant docs with EACH PR so documentaion always stays up to date and fresh.
---

### üîπ Guardrails & Boundaries

* **No hard-coded values.**
  Guild IDs, channel IDs, Sheet tabs, Sheet IDs ‚Äî always from ENV or Sheet Config.
* **Cogs must export:**
  `async def setup(bot)` only; loader awaits it.
* **External I/O:**
  Fail soft, log once, skip, never block boot.
* **Use public APIs only.**
  CoreOps ‚Üí `capabilities()`, `refresh_now()` etc.
* **Shortcuts = temporary.**
  Ask first and log cleanup tasks.
* **No new functionality without agreement.**

---

### üîπ Documentation Discipline

* **Document changes immediately after implementation.**

  * Make Codex **read** the relevant doc files first.
  * Add updates in the **existing format** and section.
  * Follow the structure in the current documentation tree (see `/docs` layout: `adr/`, `ops/`, `contracts/`, `compliance/`).
  * **Documentation Index (v0.9.4):** This index explains the intent and ownership of every file in the documentation tree. It exists so that contributors update the correct references after each development phase or PR.
  * **Quality gate:** All docs must follow [`docs/_meta/DocStyle.md`](../_meta/DocStyle.md) and pass `scripts/ci/check_docs.py`. Environment keys are authoritative in [`docs/ops/Config.md`](../ops/Config.md); keep `.env.example` synchronized.

    * **`/docs/adr/` ‚Äî Architectural Decision Records**
      * Each ADR (`ADR-XXXX`) captures an approved architectural or systemic decision.
      * `ADR-0000` serves as the template for new records.
      * File a new ADR for every major design or structural change.

    * **`/docs/compliance/`**
      * Houses internal compliance and governance policies.
      * Example: `REPORT_GUARDRAILS.md` details report formatting and safety guardrail standards.

    * **`/docs/contracts/`**
      * Defines long-term, structural interfaces between components.
      * `core_infra.md` documents runtime, Sheets access, and cache relationships.
      * Feature toggle guidance moved into other docs; keep legacy references aligned if `feature_toggles.md` is touched.

    * **`/docs/ops/` ‚Äî Operational Documentation**
      * `Architecture.md` ‚Äî detailed system flow, runtime design, and module topology.
      * `Config.md` ‚Äî environment variables, Config tab mapping, and Sheets schema (including `FEATURE_TOGGLES_TAB`).
      * `CommandMatrix.md` ‚Äî user/admin command catalogue with permissions, feature gates, and descriptions.
      * `Runbook.md` ‚Äî operator actions for routine tasks and incident handling.
      * `Troubleshooting.md` ‚Äî quick reference for diagnosing common issues.
      * `Watchers.md` ‚Äî background jobs covering schedulers, refreshers, and watchdogs.
      * `CollaborationContract.md` ‚Äî contributor standards, PR review flow, and Codex formatting instructions.
      * `development.md` ‚Äî developer setup notes and contribution workflow guidance.
      * `commands.md` ‚Äî supplemental command reference for operational usage.

    * **Root-Level Docs**
      * `README.md` ‚Äî user-facing overview, installation steps, and configuration guidance for the bot.
      * `CHANGELOG.md` ‚Äî version history for the project.

    * **Maintenance Rules**
      * Update this index whenever documentation files are added, renamed, or removed.
      * Any PR that modifies documentation must reflect its changes here and, if structural, call them out in the CollaborationContract.
      * Ensure the version shown in this index (currently v0.9.4) matches the bot version in the root `README.md`.

    * **Cross-References**
      * `docs/ops/CollaborationContract.md` documents contributor responsibilities and embeds this index under ‚ÄúDocumentation Discipline.‚Äù
      * No new docs or folders may be added without updating this index.
* **Architectural Decisions (ADR):**
  Each significant decision we agree on must be recorded under `docs/adr/` using this template format:

  ```
  ADR-0000 ‚Äî Architectural Decision Record Template
  Date: YYYY-MM-DD

  Context
  Briefly describe background, constraints, and motivation.

  Decision
  Record the chosen direction and rationale; list rejected alternatives if relevant.

  Consequences
  Note trade-offs, follow-ups, and operational impact.

  Status
  Draft
  ```

  Number new ADRs sequentially.

### üîπ Codex PR Formatting Rules

All Codex prompts must be in **one fenced code block** for clean copy/paste.
CI posts a Guardrails Summary comment with config/docs parity and leak-scan status on
every PR‚Äîreview it and note remediation in the PR body before appending the metadata block.
Append this footer **at the end** of each PR prompt (not as a header):

```markdown
**Instruction for Codex:**
At the end of the PR **body**, after all sections, append the following metadata block exactly as shown.  
Do **not** put it in the title or commit message.  
Do **not** add any text after it.  
This block must be the **final lines** of the PR body so the workflow can parse labels and milestone correctly.
[meta]
labels: <labels here>
milestone: Harmonize v1.0
[/meta]
```

### üîπ Label Reference (Approved Set)
DO not use any other labels unless approved by caillean first

```
bug, perf, robustness, security, observability, infra, architecture, devx, docs, lint,
typecheck, tests, commands, data, config,
P0, P1, P2, P3, P4,
severity:critical, severity:high, severity:medium, severity:low,
bot:reminder, bot:welcomecrew, bot:matchmaker, bot:achievements,
comp:commands, comp:scheduler, comp:health, comp:config, comp:data-sheets,
comp:cache, comp:roles, comp:onboarding, comp:placement,
comp:ocr, comp:shards, comp:ops-contract,
needs:triage, ready, blocked, help wanted, good first issue
```

---

### üîπ Source References

Legacy bot clones for reference:

```
AUDIT/legacy/clanmatch-welcomecrew/2025-10-10_code-export/MM   ‚Üí Matchmaker legacy clone
AUDIT/legacy/clanmatch-welcomecrew/2025-10-10_code-export/WC   ‚Üí WelcomeCrew legacy clone
```

---

### üîπ Recap ‚Äî Always Remember

* Don‚Äôt code until asked.
* Don‚Äôt guess: ask or read.
* One PR at a time.
* No hard-coding or invention.
* Update docs right after each change.
* Record every major decision as an ADR.
* Keep ENV + Sheet config consistent.
* Stop and ask if unsure.
