## Documentation Discipline
- Keep configuration references in sync between source, docs, and `.env` templates.

- Reflect architectural decisions in the ADR index within the same PR.

## Codex PR Formatting Rules
- Provide a concise summary of functional changes and impacted files.
- Include a dedicated testing section enumerating each executed check.
- Use repository-relative file paths in citations and reference IDs for logs.
