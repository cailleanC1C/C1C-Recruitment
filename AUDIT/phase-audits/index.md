# Phase Audits — Overview

Phase audits capture multi-step engagements that span discovery through remediation.
Each engagement gets a slug folder containing `summary.md`, `index.md`, and dated
subfolders for phases and artifacts.

## Active Engagements
- [`welcomecrew-modernization/`](welcomecrew-modernization/) — Modernization of Matchmaker and WelcomeCrew bots.

Create new engagements as `phase-audits/<slug>/` and follow the same layout when staging
future audits.
