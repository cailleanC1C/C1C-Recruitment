# The Woadkeeper Technical Overview (Audit)

## 4.1. Overview
The Woadkeeper is the unified Discord bot in this repo that merges prior recruitment, welcome/onboarding, placement, and operational utilities into one cog-based application. It spans member-facing recruitment search/panels, threaded onboarding dialogs (welcome and promo tickets), reservation upkeep, shard tracking, and admin operations such as server map refreshes and sheet-driven reports.【F:README.md†L4-L41】【F:modules/coreops/ready.py†L11-L20】

## 4.2. Module / Cog Inventory

## 4.3. Admin Commands
- **`!ping`** (`AppAdmin.ping` in `cogs/app_admin.py`): Admin-only reaction check to confirm responsiveness; reacts with 🏓 and ignores reaction failures.【F:cogs/app_admin.py†L54-L74】
- **`!servermap refresh`** (`AppAdmin.servermap_refresh`): Admin-only; refreshes server-map channel immediately. Requires `SERVER_MAP` feature flag; posts success/failure replies and logs result.【F:cogs/app_admin.py†L75-L129】
- **`!whoweare`** (`AppAdmin.whoweare`): Admin-only; renders Who We Are roster from recruitment sheet role map tab into configured channel, with cleanup of previous bot posts and logging.【F:cogs/app_admin.py†L130-L205】
- **`!welcome-refresh`** (`WelcomeBridge.welcome_refresh`): Admin-only; reloads cached welcome templates for staff command parity.【F:cogs/recruitment_welcome.py†L59-L70】
- **`!report recruiters`** (`RecruitmentReporting.report_group`): Admin-only; posts Daily Recruiter Update if the feature toggle is enabled and logs outcome; replies with usage if invoked incorrectly.【F:cogs/recruitment_reporting.py†L21-L65】

**Staff/Restricted operational commands**
- **`!welcome`** (`WelcomeBridge.welcome`): Staff-only (CoreOps staff/admin roles); posts templated welcome message for specified clan and optional note, using recruitment templates cache.【F:cogs/recruitment_welcome.py†L39-L57】

**Diagnostic/maintenance watchers (no explicit commands)**
- Cleanup watcher, permissions watcher, keepalive helper, and reservation jobs operate in the background (see §4.5.3); no direct commands but rely on env configuration.

## 4.4. Configuration Map
### 1) ENV variables
- `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `GSPREAD_CREDENTIALS`, `RECRUITMENT_SHEET_ID`, `ONBOARDING_SHEET_ID`, `PROMO_CHANNEL_ID`, `WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID`, `WELCOME_GENERAL_CHANNEL_ID`, `RECRUITERS_CHANNEL_ID`, `RECRUITERS_THREAD_ID`, `ROLEMAP_CHANNEL_ID`, `WHO_WE_ARE_CHANNEL_ID` – channel/ID wiring surfaced via config accessors used by onboarding watchers, recruitment commands, and roster rendering.【F:shared/config.py†L700-L738】
- `SERVER_MAP` toggle and related `SERVER_MAP_CHANNEL_ID` (feature flag from sheet but command checks env flag), `KEEPALIVE_URL`/`KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL`/`RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL`/`PORT` for keepalive pings.【F:cogs/app_admin.py†L99-L128】【F:modules/common/keepalive.py†L21-L120】
- Reservation/cleanup controls such as `CLEANUP_THREAD_IDS`, `CLEANUP_AGE_HOURS`, recruiter role/channel IDs for reservation jobs, and Ticket Tool bot ID gating watchers (via shared config getters).【F:modules/ops/cleanup_watcher.py†L10-L52】【F:modules/onboarding/watcher_welcome.py†L1275-L1287】

### 2) Sheets
- **Recruitment sheet**: Feature toggles (FeatureToggles tab) powering recruitment_welcome, server map, promo/welcome hooks; welcome templates; role map tab for `!whoweare`; Daily Recruiter Update source data.
- **Onboarding sheet**: Question definitions per flow, welcome/promo ticket log tabs (`WELCOME_TICKETS_TAB`, `PROMO_TICKETS_TAB`), onboarding sessions tab; schema hash loaded for dialogs.【F:modules/onboarding/welcome_flow.py†L37-L115】
- **Reservations sheet**: Reservation ledger read/write for reminders and auto-release logic; interacts with welcome ticket parsing for thread names.【F:modules/placement/reservation_jobs.py†L1-L65】

### 3) Local config files
- `config/bot_access_lists.json` (RBAC allow-lists) loaded via shared config helpers (not modified here); feature toggles resolved from sheet config per guardrails.

## 4.5. Flow Descriptions
### 4.5.1. Welcome Flow
1. **Trigger**: Ticket Tool welcome thread creation or manual 🧭 reaction/panel interaction in welcome channel; watcher checks `WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID` and toggles `welcome_dialog` and `recruitment_welcome` before registering persistent panel view.【F:modules/onboarding/watcher_welcome.py†L1275-L1344】
2. **Flow resolution**: `resolve_onboarding_flow` inspects thread parent scope; welcome threads map to `welcome` flow, promo threads parsed for ticket codes; errors logged with scope gate result.【F:modules/onboarding/welcome_flow.py†L37-L115】
3. **Question loading**: Uses `shared.sheets.onboarding_questions` cache to fetch questions and schema hash for the selected flow; errors log schema load failure.【F:modules/onboarding/welcome_flow.py†L102-L188】
4. **Dialog handling**: `WelcomeController` (welcome) or `PromoController` (promo) runs the dialog, leveraging session store for state, validation rules, and inline panel UI (text/select/modal) for answers and `Next` navigation.【F:modules/onboarding/controllers/welcome_controller.py†L1-L120】【F:modules/onboarding/session_store.py†L1-L70】
5. **Answer persistence**: Sessions track answers in memory; watcher writes ticket summaries to onboarding sheet tabs and updates reservations when appropriate (reserved/closed thread renaming helpers).【F:modules/onboarding/watcher_welcome.py†L1805-L2483】
6. **Summary generation**: UI summary embed builders craft final recap; retry view available if summary send fails; fallback embed handles exceptions.【F:modules/onboarding/controllers/welcome_controller.py†L10-L30】【F:modules/onboarding/ui/summary_embed.py†L1-L200】
7. **Thread closure/rename**: Helper functions build `Res-`/`Closed-` thread names and detect closure markers; watcher handles reminders, warnings, and auto-close after inactivity thresholds.【F:modules/onboarding/watcher_welcome.py†L53-L120】【F:modules/onboarding/watcher_welcome.py†L1805-L2483】
8. **Fallbacks**: Soft notifications sent on scope/feature gate failures; schema load/target lookup exceptions logged; manual reaction path shares same entrypoint to prevent divergence.【F:modules/onboarding/welcome_flow.py†L96-L188】【F:modules/onboarding/watcher_welcome.py†L146-L220】

### 4.5.2. Promo / Move / Leadership Flow
1. **Trigger**: Promo ticket threads in configured promo channel (`PROMO_CHANNEL_ID`) containing `<!-- trigger:promo.* -->` markers or Ticket Tool owner creation; watcher validates feature toggles `promo_enabled` and `enable_promo_hook`.【F:modules/onboarding/watcher_promo.py†L700-L744】
2. **Flow detection**: Thread name parsed (`R####/M####/L####` prefixes) to determine flow (`promo.r`, `promo.m`, `promo.l`), ticket metadata captured for sheet rows.【F:modules/onboarding/watcher_promo.py†L1-L70】
3. **Panel**: Posts open questions panel with clan tag select; uses shared panel renderer and clan tag cache; prompts user to select a clan tag when missing.【F:modules/onboarding/watcher_promo.py†L1-L120】
4. **Dialog processing**: Reuses onboarding dialog engine via `welcome_flow.start_welcome_dialog`, loading promo questions and schema hash; controller manages answers and validation similar to welcome flow.【F:modules/onboarding/welcome_flow.py†L62-L188】
5. **Summary & logging**: Promo watcher records ticket closure markers (`ticket closed`), updates onboarding sheet promo tab, and logs outcomes; supports clan tag selection updates before closure.【F:modules/onboarding/watcher_promo.py†L120-L250】【F:modules/onboarding/watcher_promo.py†L300-L380】
6. **Thread handling**: Detects archive/lock transitions to treat as closed; preserves reopen detection to avoid double-posting; uses ticket code parsing to rename or annotate threads as needed.【F:modules/onboarding/watcher_promo.py†L41-L120】

### 4.5.3. Background Jobs / Watchers
- **Welcome watcher**: Registers persistent panel view on ready, monitors welcome threads for panel interactions, reminders (3h/5h warnings), auto-close after 36h, and posts summaries/reservation updates; backed by reminder task scheduler started in setup.【F:modules/onboarding/watcher_welcome.py†L1275-L1344】【F:modules/onboarding/watcher_welcome.py†L2460-L2483】
- **Promo watcher**: Listens for promo ticket messages/closures in promo channel; posts panel and records ticket rows when toggles enabled.【F:modules/onboarding/watcher_promo.py†L700-L744】
- **Reservation jobs**: Daily reminder and auto-release tasks for reservations ledger; iterates due rows, posts reminders to recruiter channel, recomputes availability context, and logs releases.【F:modules/placement/reservation_jobs.py†L1-L120】
- **Permission watcher**: Applies bot permission profile to new/moved channels to keep overwrites in sync.【F:modules/ops/watchers_permissions.py†L17-L64】
- **Cleanup watcher**: Deletes old messages in configured threads on a schedule using env-configured thread IDs and age threshold.【F:modules/ops/cleanup_watcher.py†L10-L80】
- **Keepalive**: Periodic HTTP pings using env-configured URL/interval or Render URL+port fallback to keep service responsive.【F:modules/common/keepalive.py†L21-L120】

## 4.6. Other User-Facing Features
- **Server map**: Admin `!servermap refresh` rebuilds #server-map post using live guild structure; depends on FeatureToggles flag and channel env ID.【F:cogs/app_admin.py†L75-L129】
- **Who We Are roster**: Admin `!whoweare` posts role map roster derived from recruitment sheet into configured channel, cleaning old posts for readability.【F:cogs/app_admin.py†L130-L205】
- **Shard tracker**: Member-facing shard tracking lives under `modules/community/shard_tracker` (not detailed here) and is part of Woadkeeper per README scope; operates in member threads (out of onboarding scope).【F:README.md†L14-L24】

## 4.7. Open Questions / Ambiguities
- Promo watcher relies on HTML trigger comments and thread name parsing; unclear whether Ticket Tool always injects the trigger markers in all environments—worth validating against production channel history.【F:modules/onboarding/watcher_promo.py†L1-L70】
- Reservation job feature gating spans multiple keys (`FEATURE_RESERVATIONS`, `placement_reservations`), suggesting legacy toggle aliases; confirm which sheet keys remain authoritative before altering reminders/autorelease cadence.【F:modules/placement/reservation_jobs.py†L13-L24】
- Welcome watcher writes reservation updates and ticket logs; interplay between manual `!welcome` command and automated dialog summaries may require further parity checks (not visible in this audit).【F:cogs/recruitment_welcome.py†L39-L70】【F:modules/onboarding/watcher_welcome.py†L1805-L2483】
