# Guardrails Rollout Inventory

| Artifact | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| docs/ENGINEERING.md | Missing | No engineering handbook or guardrails overview yet. |
| docs/DEVELOPMENT.md | Missing | No consolidated development workflow reference exists. |
| docs/ADR/ | Missing | No ADR directory or recorded decisions found. |
| REVIEW/* | Present (partial) | Existing review artifacts (FINDINGS, TESTPLAN, etc.) live at repo root; no module-specific folders yet. |
| REVIEW/BOOTSTRAP_GUARDRAILS | Present | Planning pack scaffold created in this PR. |
| .github/issue-batches/ | Present (minimal) | New guardrails-rollout planning batch added; no other batches exist. |
| .github/labels/harmonized.json | Missing | Label canon not established. |
| .github/workflows/*.yml | Missing | No automation workflows present. |
| .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE / PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE | Missing | No templates detected; .github/ is otherwise empty before this work. |
| CODEOWNERS | Missing | Repository has no CODEOWNERS declaration. |

## Observations
- REVIEW directory currently stores aggregated outputs rather than module-specific subdirectories, so legacy artifacts may need relocation during guardrails rollout.
- Labels and workflow automation are entirely absent, simplifying bootstrap but requiring greenfield planning.
