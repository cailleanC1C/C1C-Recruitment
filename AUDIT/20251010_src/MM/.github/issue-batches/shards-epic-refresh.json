      "title": "Feature: Use custom server shard emojis everywhere",
      "body": "**Why**: Policy requires shard counters and UI to display server-specific emoji, not unicode placeholders.\n\n**Scope**: Introduce a central emoji mapping (JSON + helper), validate Sheets overrides, and replace unicode fallbacks across cog, views, renderer, and help copy.",
