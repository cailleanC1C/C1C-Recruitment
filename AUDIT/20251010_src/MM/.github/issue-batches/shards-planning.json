      "title": "Feature: Manual entry (Skip OCR) on first panel",
      "body": "**Why**: Staff need to bypass OCR from the opening prompt so misreads or missing attachments do not block manual count entry.\n\n**Scope**: Add the Manual entry (Skip OCR) control alongside Scan Image and Dismiss, wire it to the existing modal without touching OCR caches, and confirm manual logging works when no attachment is present.",
      "labels": ["bot: achievements", "area: shards", "type: feature", "status: ready"],
      "acceptance_criteria": [
        "First-panel prompt shows Manual entry (Skip OCR) alongside Scan Image and Dismiss.",
        "Invoking the button opens the manual modal without triggering OCR or cache lookups.",
        "Manual path works whether or not an attachment is present, limited to shard threads.",
        "Audit/log entries clearly record the manual path choice for analytics.",
        "Interaction honours existing timeout/ephemeral behaviour so buttons tidy themselves up."

        "Run Discord interaction in a shard thread with an image: choose Manual entry, submit counts, verify summary/logs.",

      "title": "Feature: Custom shard emojis via centralized mapping",
      "body": "**Why**: Emoji usage drifts across layers today; a shared registry ensures previews, modals, embeds, and logs render the same custom IDs and surface configuration gaps.\n\n**Scope**: Create a single emoji registry keyed by shard band, require all render paths to consume it, add health/info warnings for missing IDs, and update documentation with sourcing expectations.",
      "labels": ["bot: achievements", "area: shards", "type: feature", "status: ready"],
      "acceptance_criteria": [
        "All shard renders (preview, manual modal, final summary, logging) source emoji from one centralized registry of IDs.",
        "Health/info command surfaces an explicit warning for any shard key missing an emoji ID.",
        "Documentation reflects setup steps for maintaining the emoji registry and required IDs.",
        "Fallback unicode squares are removed; any intentional text fallback is explicit and logged."
      ],
      "test_plan": [
        "Trigger OCR preview and manual modal to confirm each surface pulls custom emoji IDs from the registry.",
        "Run health/info command with a missing mapping to observe the warning, then restore the entry and confirm it clears.",
