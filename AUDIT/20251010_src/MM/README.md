# C1C Achievement Bot v1.0.3

A Discord bot for the C1C cluster that **celebrates member achievements and milestones**.
It automatically posts **warm, styled shout-outs** when specific roles are granted, keeps #levels tidy by grouping multiple unlocks, and gives Guardian Knights tools to process screenshot claims without flooding chat.

---

## Features

* üéâ **Smart appreciation messages** when achievement or level roles are granted
* üß© **Grouping logic** to combine bursts of unlocks into one neat post
* üõ° **Guardian Knight review flow** for screenshot-based claims
* üìú **Audit-log entries** only for roles that matter
* üß™ **Preview/testing tools** for admins before going cluster-wide
* üìä **Google Sheets configuration** (Achievements, Levels, Categories, Reasons, General)

--- 

## What‚Äôs new in v1.0.3

* **Shared OpsCommands** introduced: all bots now use scoped prefixes for health, digest, reload, etc.
* **Appreciation logic refined**: multiple role grants in a short window become one combined message.
* **Guardian Knight review flow**: screenshot claims thread + standardized ‚ÄúReasons‚Äù for approvals/denials.
* **Audit filtering**: only configured role names show up in the audit channel.
* **Preview commands**: admins can test how appreciation posts will look before rollout.

---

## Quick start (admins)

1. **Invite the bot** to your server with the usual Discord bot link.
2. **Set up the Google Sheet** with the required tabs (General, Categories, Achievements, Levels, Reasons).
3. **Configure IDs** in the General sheet (levels channel, claims thread, audit log, Guardian Knights role).
4. **Grant Guardian Knights** their role so they can process claims.
5. **Test** using `!testach` or `!testlevel` to make sure appreciation posts look right.

## Shared OpsCommands

Like the Reminder Bot, this bot uses the **shared CoreOps model**.
All bots share the same admin commands (`health`, `digest`, `reload`, etc.), but each listens only to its own prefix:

* **Achievement Bot (Scribe):** `!sc health`, `!sc digest`, ‚Ä¶
* **Reminder Bot:** `!rem ‚Ä¶`
* **Welcome Crew:** `!wc ‚Ä¶`
* **Matchmaker:** `!mm ‚Ä¶`

Typing a bare command like `!health` prompts you to pick which bot you mean.
`!ping` remains global (one-liner react only).

## Commands

### Admin / Ops (scoped to `!sc`)

* `!sc health` ‚Äî Show full health info (version, config source, table counts, status line).
* `!sc digest` ‚Äî Quick one-liner health digest.
* `!sc reload` ‚Äî Reload configuration from Sheets or local file.
* `!sc checksheet` ‚Äî Show which Google Sheet (or local file) is active.

## How it works

* Members earn roles for achievements, milestones, or special champion unlocks.
* The bot detects those roles and posts a **celebratory message** in your levels channel.
* If several roles are granted close together, the bot groups them into **one combined message**.
* Guardian Knights can review screenshot claims in a dedicated thread, approve/deny with reasons, and keep the process consistent.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **No messages appear:** check that the role is listed in the Achievements or Levels sheet.
* **Duplicate or missing posts:** adjust the grouping window in the General sheet.
* **Audit entries missing:** make sure the role name is flagged for logging in the sheet.
* **Guardian Knight commands not working:** confirm the correct role ID is set for Guardian Knights.
* **Still stuck?** Use `!sc health` to see if the bot can read your sheet and channels.
