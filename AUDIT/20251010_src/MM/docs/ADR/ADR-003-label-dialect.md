# ADR-003 — Label dialect (harmonized)
**Status:** Accepted • **Date:** 2025-10-08

## Decision
Use `.github/labels/harmonized.json` as the single source of truth.
Examples: `bot:achievements`, `comp:shards`, `feature|epic`, `ready|blocked`, `P0..P4`, `severity:*`.

## Consequences
- Batch issue files must use only canon labels.
- CI will fail PRs that introduce unknown/variant labels.
