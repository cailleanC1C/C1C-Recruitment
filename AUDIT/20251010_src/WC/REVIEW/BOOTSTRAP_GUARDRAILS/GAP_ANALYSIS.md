# Guardrails Gap Analysis

- **Global Engineering Docs — Major**: ENGINEERING.md and DEVELOPMENT.md are absent, leaving no single-source reference for guardrails or day-to-day developer expectations.
- **Architectural Decision Records — Major**: No docs/ADR directory or records exist, so historical decisions cannot be traced.
- **Review & Module Artifacts — Minor**: REVIEW folder contains legacy aggregate files instead of module-specific subdirectories; requires restructuring to align with target pattern.
- **Issue Batches — Minor**: Planning batch created in this effort, but broader backlog batching process is undefined and lacks supporting documentation.
- **Labels Canon — Major**: Missing harmonized.json prevents consistent labeling and future automation.
- **Workflows — Minor**: No GitHub Actions defined; acceptable for planning phase but needs introduction before automation guardrails launch.
- **Templates & CODEOWNERS — Major**: Absence of issue/PR templates and CODEOWNERS blocks workflow standardization and review routing.
