# Changelog
## [1.0.1] — 2025-10-07
### Tooling & Process
- Unified label taxonomy across bots via `.github/labels/labels.json` (synced by **Sync Labels**): one `P0–P4`, plus `bot:*` and `comp:*` scopes.
- Migrated off legacy `area:*` labels and pruned leftovers; boards and filters are now consistent org-wide.
- Added per-repo workflow to auto-add issues to **C1C Cross-Bot Hotlist** and set project **Priority** from `P*` labels; saved views added for **Data Sheets — Perf**, **Ops Parity**, **Security Hotlist**, and **Needs Triage**.
